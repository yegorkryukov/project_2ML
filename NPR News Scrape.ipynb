       "[\"[Updated at 914 am ET Mexico is putting tariffs on imports of US steel and farm products — including pork cheese apples and potatoes — as it hits back at the US for the Trump administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum products from Mexico Canada and the European Union Signed by Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto the decree also suspends the country's preferential tariff treatment of the US It was published in Mexico's official gazette on Tuesday The list of US agricultural products nearly all of which will be subject to taxes of 15 percent to 25 percent also includes Tennessee or bourbon whiskey and cranberries US steel products on the list include steel plates bars and rods along with rolled steel The list also includes motor boats The move comes one day after Mexico's Economy Ministry said it will start proceedings against the US in the World Trade Organization where it's seeking a dispute settlement over the US tariffs on Mexican products — 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum — formally took effect last Friday Canada and the European Union have protested along with Mexico and are also pursuing tariffs and cases against the US at the WTO These countermeasures will only apply to goods originating from the US and will take effect on July 1 and will remain in place until the US eliminates its trade-restrictive measures against Canada Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the US tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel unacceptable As NPR's Brian Naylor reported Trudeau also tweeted that Canada will take retaliatory measures effective July 1 on products ranging from steel to whiskey And shortly after the US tariffs took effect last week Europe's top trade commissioner said the EU also will now consider rebalancing measures We are not seeking to escalate any situation but not responding would be the same as accepting these tariffs which we consider are illegal Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said]\",\n",
       " \"[Bullying takes many forms but when it involves a food that triggers severe allergies it could be potentially deadly Once when Brandon Williams a 16-year-old from Kentucky was on a trip with his bowling team his teammate decided to eat some food from McDonald's on Williams' bed One item had so much mayonnaise that it dripped onto Williams' bed and jacket But for Williams who was diagnosed with a life-threatening egg allergy when he was one it was a potentially dangerous situation I told the person not to eat on my bed Williams recalls His teammate just smiled at him then he shoved the mayonnaise-laden sandwich in Williams' face It's always the same People wave food near Williams that they know he can't eat They see him and yell Hey let's feed this guy egg It's not original all the jokes are the same kind of thing Williams says yet the bullying carries an undercurrent of risk It wouldn't be funny to break someone's arm to send them to the hospital Williams says Why would it be funny to send someone to the hospital for an allergy One 2014 study found that as many as 32 percent of children with food allergies have been bullied at least once Roughly a third of bullied children were bullied more than twice a month according to the study in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology  Food allergy bullying was something we were hearing more about says Rachel Annunziato associate professor of psychology at Fordham and one of the study's authors They did the study to find out if it was a real phenomenon and discovered that far more children experienced it than they expected It didn't matter how serious the allergy was or whether the kids were allergic to peanuts or wheat or shellfish As Brandon's mother Kandice Williams put it The nature of humanity is I guess to find cracks and attack there While it's hard to know for certain it's unlikely that food allergy bullying is a new phenomenon But the number of children diagnosed with food allergies is growing which means it could harm more people From 1997 to 2007 the number of children with food allergies increased by 18 percent according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Hospitalizations associated with these allergies also continue to grow Raising awareness about the issue is important says Sanaz Eftekhari director of corporate affairs at Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America If a child doesn't understand the consequences or life-threatening nature of an allergy and thinks bullying someone is the same as calling someone a name that's when it becomes really dangerous she says Food allergy awareness has increased in the last decade or so but I think food allergy bullying is a new aspect Eftekhari says Parents and schools can make a big difference in how kids with food allergies are treated Many students with serious food allergies — which qualify as a disability under the law — set up a 504 plan a written blueprint for how schools will accommodate that student's needs This has led to things like Nut-Free Zones in the classroom or lunchroom which makes it less likely that there will be accidental ingestion of an allergen but does little to discourage would-be bullies from putting someone with an allergy in harm's way You can't stop bullying by focusing on the victim alone Annunziato found that when schools have zero-tolerance for bullying and teach bystanders to step in it decreases the trajectory of being a bully Today there are schools that go above and beyond nut-free zones Williams and his mother both say that his school is generally really good about responding to food allergy bullying as long as he reports it But especially as a child gets older they prefer to handle many of these situations themselves rather than running to a teacher or principal That's why it can be important to address allergies in the curriculum as well as increasing general awareness Washington Yu Ying is a public charter school in DC that has woven food allergy awareness into the curriculum since it opened a decade ago We wanted to be as inclusive as possible of anything and everything says co-founder and principal Amy Quinn Though they only have a small percentage of kids with allergies in each grade Quinn says they've added books that deal with food allergies There are a number of them The Princess and the Peanut Allergy Can I Have Some Cake Too and What Treat Can Rubin Eat barely scratch the surface of these titles Every year students wind up doing projects on food allergies at Yu Ying's STEM fair We ask those kids to present to their class about their experiment and that's been successful too Quinn says Despite that even Yu Ying has had run-ins with food allergy bullying — generally from first and second graders Quinn says that those are the years when kids start to hone in on differences between them and their classmates but are not so mature that they're thinking through decisions she explains We're not sure that they're doing it repeatedly but they're doing it with the knowledge that it's not the nicest thing to do Then it's back to the classroom to make sure the bully and other students all know that bullying someone with food allergies is more than just teasing more than just a prank]\",\n",

       " \"[It's been the story since Trump was elected Dueling massive crowds showed up in Washington in January 2017 — on one day supporters of the newly inaugurated president and the next an enormous gathering of opponents for the Women's March with largely women leading the resistance A year-and-a-half later that dynamic has played out in the early contests of this year's crucial midterm primaries President Trump and the allegiance he's inspired among his base as well as the outrage he has stirred on the left — particularly among Democratic women — have been two of the dominant storylines of 2018 And now we enter the busiest stretch of the primary season beginning with eight states holding primaries Tuesday Just how busy will June be Almost two thirds of the country 31 states will have voted by July overall 71 percent of House races will be set and just over half of Senate ones Here are the four big messages voters have been sending with their votes so far in the 2018 midterm primaries 1 The Republican Party is Trump's party now \\n                President Trump is fully in control of the GOP He's the most influential person in the party and candidates are fashioning themselves after him\\n                \\n                \\n                    \\n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n President Trump is fully in control of the GOP He's the most influential person in the party and candidates are fashioning themselves after him President Trump continues to dominate news coverage and wields more influence in his party than anyone else — and Republicans running for office know it Anyone who thought Republicans fearing Trump's historically low approval ratings would run away from this president were wrong — in primaries anyway That may change in the fall when some of these candidates need to tack to the middle but right now they're with their president Why Because GOP voters approve of Trump at record levels Several GOP candidates have hitched their wagons to Trump sensing that's what their voters want from candidates in Indiana who tried to out-Trump each other to one in West Virginia who said he was Trumpier than Trump after the president told GOP voters to vote for anyone other than him And speaking out against the president can present dangers Look at Rep Martha Roby in Alabama who drew a crowded primary field because she criticized the president after the Access Hollywood tape came out before the 2016 election That has meant a Republican Party that is increasingly fashioning itself a party of one There is no Republican Party There's a Trump Party former House Speaker John Boehner said last week The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere One of the men vying to become the next House speaker California GOP Rep Kevin McCarthy told CNN that the party's evolution is a good thing Well I would think it's changed for the better he said in response to Boehner's comment McCarthy cited the country's relative peace and prosperity under Trump And Trump has certainly benefited from that as well His approval rating for example has gone from 37 percent in December to almost 45 percent now according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls The question is whether that improvement will be enough for the Republican Party and its candidates who are facing historical midterm challenges because so much of the enthusiasm is with the party out of power 2 Democratic women are running and winning Speaking of that enthusiasm in primary after primary so far it's been Democratic women making a statement So far more than 40 percent of House Democratic nominees have been women according to NBC News A record number of women are running for the House and Senate in 2018 Overall 417 women have filed to run But nearly three times as many women have filed to run as Democrats than Republicans (310 to 107) according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University So far 159 total women have appeared on primary ballots in these early contests Of those 80 percent (126) have been Democrats Overall 74 women have won primaries and the lion's share (85 percent) have been Democratic women Cut another way half of the Democratic women running in primaries so far have won (63 out of 126) while a third of Republican women have won (11 of 33) So when people talk about the year of the woman so far it's been the year of the Democratic woman 3 It hasn't been a good year to be a congressional Republican Only one incumbent has lost a primary so far That was Republican Robert Pittenger from North Carolina who was upset by an underfunded Baptist minister Democrats think that could open up the seat as a target in the general election Other Republican congressional candidates have been denied job promotions From West Virginia to Indiana to Idaho that's been the case Instead what voters seem to value in Republican candidates is being an outsider businessman Mike Braun captured that in Indiana winning the GOP nomination for the Senate by running ads showing him walking around the state with cardboard cutouts of his similar-looking opponents both of whom were congressmen There have been a record number of retirements among House Republicans and it's looking increasingly likely that the GOP House conference is moving even more toward the right-wing Freedom Caucus as the Washington Post's Dave Weigel reports 4 Democrats' intraparty fight hasn't amounted to much — yet  \\n                Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez hasn't quite figured out how to calm the restive Democratic base but the left hasn't bitten the Democratic Party just yet\\n                \\n

figured out how to calm the restive Democratic base but the left hasn't bitten the Democratic Party just yet As much as the Trump wing has flexed its muscle on the GOP side the same can't be said for the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party at least not yet anyway Progressives claimed one scalp in Nebraska defeating a former congressman with a more liberal candidate but that is looking more and more like an aberration rather than a trend The left has had opportunities in Texas and Pennsylvania for example but those challenges fizzled Progressives however believe they have pushed Democrats on the issues For example many Democratic candidates are now talking about Medicare-for-all and a 15 minimum wage Are Democrats showing their pragmatic side or have progressives just not hit their groove yet After all there's still plenty of irritation among them with the establishment wing of the party Check out what happened when Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez endorsed New York Gov Andrew Cuomo over Cynthia Nixon of Sex and the City fame Not everyone on the DNC leadership team was on board with the decision The Democratic Party should not intervene in the primary process DNC Deputy Chairman Keith Ellison said in a statement after learning of Perez's endorsement It is our role to be fair to all contestants and let the voters decide The bottom line is Democrats are unified for the most part against Trump That may be enough to make gains in 2018 but a fight is coming on the direction of the party — whether it's in this year's midterms or in two years in what's already shaping up to be a very crowded 2020 presidential field]\",\n",
       " \"[Sen Chuck Schumer Great to be here You and other top Democrats have sent this letter to President Trump outlining how you think his administration should move forward in negotiations with North Korea You agree that the goal should be quote complete verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear program As part of that you write No concessions should be granted that could undermine our core alliance commitments or our posture in the region Are you concerned that the Trump administration would offer concessions without getting enough in return Yeah the worry we have is the president will be so eager for quote an agreement that it won't protect the security first and foremost of the United States When you have North Korea with ICBM capability and nuclear capability it's extremely dangerous to have an agreement that doesn't dismantle that and remove the danger from the United States — would be really troublesome for it to continue And secondarily we've had allies that we've had since World War II — in South Korea and Japan in particular Australia on the periphery Philippines — and we have to do things in accord with them and protect their security as well Why did you feel it important to write this letter I mean do you have any evidence that would suggest that the administration wouldn't also be concerned about those issues The administration has been somewhat erratic in how it has done this They've moved rather precipitously without real guidelines in effect And everyone knows that there are many times when Donald Trump likes the show of it as opposed to the substance of it And the substance is vital here because our security is at stake Now we may be wrong on this Maybe he's gonna you know just demand the kinds of things that we've requested So so much for the — that would be so much better and we hope it happens But we've got to be  we have to set out set out signals that that is a bottom line not just gratuitous How do you reinforce the bottom line I mean is this just talk at this point What what mechanism do you have what leverage do you have to make sure that the administration does what you want them to do Well first first I think laying out five principles clearly does set some real some real parameters that the public — the American public — will judge the president by Second obviously if he comes to an agreement one of the things that North Korea wants most is removal of sanctions And in the past when it comes to Russia and others in a bipartisan way when Congress has not agreed with what the president has done we have taken away his ability to waive sanctions That's something that you could see happening again It's very possible because a good number of our Republican colleagues — probably I don't think they'd send him a letter publicly that's you know because they're of the same party but a good number of our Republican colleagues agree with every one of these principles And realize I think bipartisan realize the danger to America if North Korea continues on the path it's continued But it has to be a give-and-take — in any negotiation North Korea's going to expect something Well what North Korea will expect is being welcomed into the community of nations being able to trade economically and things like that And those are fine incentives but they ought only to be granted when we achieve our goals — not ahead of time In the past North Korea has proved to be a very unreliable negotiating partner — they promised things and backed off they've lied and we have to really be strong here Because the danger is much greater than in previous negotiations because North Korea's nuclear capability is large and for the first time it seems quite clear that they have ICBMs Let me ask you also in the letter you — you urged the president to continue to take a quote tough approach to China to make sure that China's doing everything it can to make sure North Korea is complying with any potential deal Are the Trump administration's new trade tariffs on China part of that I mean do you believe those tariffs are a good idea One doesn't know I believe that I have said repeatedly that my views on trade with China — not trade in the rest of the world but on trade with China — are closer to President Trump's than they were to President Obama or President Bush We need to be really tough on China for economic reasons So you like what he's doing You like these sanctions Well it's unclear what he's doing Take ZTE — that was a golden opportunity to show This is the Chinese telecom that Donald Trump propped up The Chinese telecom Golden opportunity to show the Chinese we meant business — he talked tough and then backed off So we don't know where it's going to end up with China because again sort of like with North Korea the administration's a) been erratic and b) has different voices saying different things You know — secretary of Treasury seems to be different than [US Trade Representative Robert] Lighthizer and [Director of the White House National Trade Council Peter] Navarro So we have to wait and see but if the president were tough on China I think it would have two benefits One that would make China more not less inclined to help us on North Korea because that is the mother lode — that's what they care about But B) and maybe just as importantly China has been stealing our intellectual property our jobs our wealth for 20 years Gen Keith Alexander (hardly a hyperbolic man a four-star general who was head of cybersecurity) said and this plagues me no — there has been no greater transfer of wealth in the history of the world as has occurred in the last 20 years as China Chinese companies have stolen the intellectual property of American companies That can't be allowed to continue or our economy will eventually sink So you like the focus at least — when you said you're closer to Donald Trump than you were to Barack Obama on this issue — you like the focus that this president is putting on China and trade I don't think either previous president did much to show China they meant business Trump has talked about it; he hasn't yet done it B ut let's wait and see The backing off of ZTE disappointed both — when the president backed off on sanctions against ZTE which really damages our national security if they were to be allowed here both parties reacted strongly and it looks like Congress will overrule the president and not allow him to undo the sanctions But if I could ask you just yes or no  do you approve of these tariffs on steel and aluminum against China Steel and aluminum have not been directed at China Steel — China does not does not send us much steel or much aluminum Those have been more directed at Mexico at Canada at the EU And my view is we should be in alliance with them pushing China to do more as opposed to having these other skirmishes right now Republicans Now that doesn't mean you know — I think we have to be tougher on trade in general but China should be the number one focus And the steel and aluminum do not make China the number one focus I want to ask you  Republican Sen Bob Corker of Tennessee tweeted out over the weekend I am working with like-minded Republican senators on ways to push back on the president using authorities in ways never intended and that are damaging to our country and our allies Will Democrats join us Sen Corker there referring to the president's trade positions The Democrats have already joined with Republicans on saying for instance that the president cannot remove these sanctions that commerce opposed on ZTE On what  I'm not sure what Sen Corker has in mind; I'd certainly be open to talking to him Midterm elections are rapidly approaching primaries are already well underway The Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said late last week that control of the Senate is absolutely in play Do you agree I think you know the conventional wisdom is very hard for Democrats to take back the Senate when you look at the geography from 10000 feet When you look at what's happening in each state McConnell's right — it's definitely in play Does President Trump deserve any credit for the strong economy right now Look the bottom line is we've had better years under President Obama in terms of the major criteria — job growth wage growth — than this year So I think Obama deserves most of the credit If you — the tax cut that the president enacted may give some temporary lift to the economy but it's mainly aimed at the top 10 percent and 1 percent And the middle class — that one bill which contained things that are detrimental to health care premiums probably took more away from the middle class than it gave Are you worried that voters see you as the resistance — a party defined in its opposition to President Trump We work with the president when we can — trying to on China trying to here on North Korea; when he's wrong we oppose him We have to be guided by our own internal gyroscope Plain and simple Let me ask you about some news the president has made tweeting about what he has described as his absolute power to pardon himself This coming in response to a letter that his lawyers sent to Special Counsel Robert Mueller He said had the absolute power to pardon himself and then a few minutes later he said that the special counsel is unconstitutional He's 0 for 2 on the Constitution We do not have a dictatorship; the Founding Fathers did not want a king That means no one including the president himself is above the law He's just dead wrong We should make it clear the president says he's done nothing wrong but it is within his power he argues to pardon himself His own lawyer Rudy Giuliani says that would be impeachable; it would be politically untenable If he were to pardon himself is that something that — would you move towards impeachment Look let's hope the president doesn't do that plain and simple — we don't want to get to the point where there is a constitutional crisis And we've been doing everything we can to urge the president to avoid it But I'll say this For someone who keeps loudly proclaiming his innocence he sure doesn't act like it If he did then why would he want to talk about pardoning himself Lastly your Democratic colleagues Heidi Heitkamp and Claire McCaskill have been openly critical of Hillary Clinton — comments that she has made about people who voted for Donald Trump Now former President Bill Clinton has made comments to the press this week about his own impeachment Are Bill and Hillary Clinton still helpful as public faces of the Democratic Party You know I haven't heard Bill Clinton's comments I just got here — but the bottom line is Democrats have to put forward a positive strong economic program We have to oppose Donald Trump when he's wrong but we also have sit and do positive things So hypotheticals who's good who's bad — we have to focus on the things that average working-class middle-class Americans need You've known Donald Trump a long time Yes In the beginning about a year ago it seemed like you were kind of getting along You know we still talk to each other Do you And I would never — How often would you say Every so often I can give you an exact moment I talked to him a couple of weeks ago on trade I called and we talked for a half hour encouraging him to be strong on China He had his advisers there How's your relationship How would you characterize it now Well we are certainly adversaries and I think he's doing damage to our democracy and damage to the middle class in this country —I don't think he's kept his promises But I'll never cut off a line of communication Senate Minority — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer thank you for your time sir Thank you]\",\n",
       " \"[Tim Cook who has led Apple since 2011 spoke with NPR's Steve Inskeep in a wide-ranging interview on Monday as the company kicked off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference Steve Inskeep I want to begin with some news that you made — and by the time people will hear this interview we will have explained essentially what it was — having to do with screen time and parental controls I want to get at the thinking behind that What if anything bothers you about the amount of time people are spending on your phones Apple CEO Tim Cook If you back up and think about what we've — what we're about — we've never been about maximizing usage of our devices It's never been a focus of ours What we've always try to do is infuse humanity into our products and give you something that amplifies something you want to do or enables you to create something that you couldn't create otherwise And it — sort of to make your difference in the world And so that's where we've always been about There's clearly users out there that are worried about the amount of time they're spending or the amount of distraction or interruptions that they get So we thought really deeply about this and sort of our latest is what you call a Screen Time But we've done many things over the years; this is sort of the latest thing that we're doing And essentially it's about giving you insight so you know how much time you're spending where you're spending it how many times per hour you're picking up a device how many notifications you get who's sending those to you And so — because we want to give the power to the user Right now we can all almost kid ourselves a bit about how much time we're spending and whether we're distracted or not There's nothing like getting a report of facts to see what is happening to you And parents are obviously very interested in having this for their kids as well We've been doing things for parental control since the creation of the App Store but this gives parents another huge tool to use I want to ask about your thinking though because you could say I'm responding to demand and there's some shareholders that wanted this but are you actually bothered are you actually concerned by the possibility that what you argue is a social good could be a social detriment I think there are cases in life where anything good used to the extreme becomes not good And so just like — you know I can eat healthy food all day but if I eat too much it's no longer good anymore And so I think just like that you can depend on your device so much and spend so much time on certain apps or pick up your phone so many times during the day that this is no longer good But this was literally your ambition as a company right To make sure that people use everything through their phone  No No that's the interesting thing We're in a very unique position because we have never been about maximizing the number of times you pick it up the number of hours that you use it — But you maximize the number of things you can do with it that's for sure We do that yes because we want it to be an incredible device for you And so you know we've provided a way for — we have health information on it financial information you can pay with it And so all these things are great conveniences of life They change your daily life in a great way But if you're getting bombarded by notifications all day long you — that's probably a use of the system that might not be so good anymore Is there a little bit of conflict that you have to think about Because you are offering people ways to limit their screen time while speaking to this giant conference of thousands of people developers who are in business to go sell products through your app store that would encourage people to use the phone more No I don't see it as that because we always put the user at the center And so the user is our focus And so our question is always what is in their best interest How can we serve them best And I think arguably just like the watch has given us a way to measure your exercise time in a day your activity in a day the number of times you're standing — all of these things have presented the the user with powerful information that they didn't have before I mean I know from my own experience you can kind of kid yourself that you've done something really well and then you look at the facts and they're a bit different And so what this is about is taking the power from the institutions and giving it to people And Apple has always been about that Do you agree with people who use the word addiction Talk about addiction to smartphones I'm not a clinician and so uh I don't know What I do know is that you can use something too much And I know some users are — I don't know really what percentage but I know some users are concerned about it And I'm concerned about it And so I think that both the reporting and being able to put limits on yourself — you can say I'm going to budget just like you budget for financially how much money you're going to spend in a month — you can budget how much in a day you want to spend online or in a certain app There might be some apps you don't want to put a limit on because it's inherently good Maybe it's — maybe it's books and you want to read and so forth And so this is a very personal decision It's not one that a company — Apple or anyone — should be making for you on your behalf But what we want to do is provide you great tools so you can make a judgment for yourself You also made some news by announcing some changes to your web browser and elsewhere which you say will make it more difficult for outside parties to track what you do online to track your data Are you deliberately making your platforms more hostile for companies that do business like Facebook which was mentioned in your presentation We're not targeting any single company We are targeting a practice of people collecting information without the vast majority of users knowing that it's being collected We think that when a person leaves one Web site and goes to another and another and another they do not have a reasonable expectation that that original Web site is still following their every move And so we want to do what we can do there to try to prevent that But we're not taking the ability of — if somebody you know is on the NPR app we think it's fine and rational that the person that NPR knows that person is there and knows something about them assuming the user has elected to share that What we don't think is —when you leave there we don't think the surveillance engine should stay And so we are stepping in and trying to do something there — again on behalf of the user giving the power to the user As Craig showed in the demo you can perfectly say yes send the information to whoever it is I want people to know that you have emphasized that your company does not intend to make money off of data mining does not intend to make money off of advertising; you make money by selling hardware But you're addressing a developers conference here where there's a lot of app developers who may well rely on advertising who may well rely on data Well let me correct something you said there We don't believe there's anything wrong with digital advertising It's a key part of people's business models and we think it's perfectly fine It's the crafting of a detailed profile and tracking you in places where you don't reasonably expect to be tracked and companies gathering information well beyond what you would have voluntarily shared if you knew what they were doing — that's what we have a problem with We have no issue at all with digital advertising I think it's — it can be a very good model You don't agree with some critics who are saying that that is distorting the information that people receive that is creating the wrong incentives for companies that produce content I think we've always had advertising with content You know if you if you turn on your TV in eight minutes of the 30 there's going to be ads — Yeah but it's different online And the incentives become different online because you need to get people to click and click again and click again Well it's not different inherently; it's different because the society has made it different And this I think we have to take another look at The last thing that as a user we probably want is to take part in a clickbait scenario Right I don't really think the vast majority of people want to do that and so hopefully our moves today and our past moves will will help the situation Is there a better business model than the business model that lots of companies are using Facebook being the most famous example but there must be thousands of others that do approximately the same thing Again on the digital we have no issue with digital advertising But data mining you have or excessive data tracking you do have an issue It's the collection of information beyond what the person is fully and completely aware is taking place and the building of this detailed profile I think — I think that steps over a boundary You started this conference by saying that your goal and your company's goal is to make the world a better place which is something I'm sure you've said before As you think about the tech industry and your long experience in it are there ways that the tech industry is making the world less equal Making people less equal I think that the society in general and certainly in the United States but outside of the United States as well this — the inequality issue is growing in almost every country And we've taken a deep look at ourselves and said What can we do to try to make that better And our conclusion was for us that we could make a major contribution in education We believe that America needs huge investments in education and infrastructure And so on the education — this is one we have deep experience in And we think a core part of that is if coding were taught in every school this would be a really great thing Because coding is not just for software engineers — the truth is software is touching us all every minute of the day And so everyone should have a view of what's possible And you really want to introduce kids to that you know as early as possible and as — and in you know should have progression through grades as you do mathematics and so forth And so we prepared a curriculum and made it free for all of education — we've given it away And — in addition to some of our philanthropic work with different underprivileged schools Well that's trying to mitigate a problem But I'm asking if you feel that on some level the tech industry has become part of the problem You're creating so much wealth you're creating enormous prosperity for a lot of people but we're here in Silicon Valley where home prices for example are so expensive that the average person couldn't afford to live here You have a tendency that you could trace of increasing the divide between people I think — I think to some degree I believe you're mixing things There is — there's a huge issue in the Valley with affordable housing And clearly something needs to be done about it I'm just giving that as an example of — Yeah but it's a great example — and it affects our employees as well by the way And and so — but I don't see a cause and effect there Has the growth in tech amplified it Yes I think that's — I think that's accurate to say But basically you have a mismatch between the investment in infrastructure and the desire for jobs And much has to be sorted out there You said that the growth in tech has amplified that particular problem Has the growth in tech amplified inequality broadly across society I do — I think that no not really I think that tech affects every industry at this point And so I get your question as a tech industry but tech affects all of the — all of the world and every industry in the world at this point from medical to industrial and so forth And so tech has brought a level of productivity And what I do believe has happened — I don't believe this is a tech-only thing — is that globalization that's happened over the last few decades has brought about winners and losers Not just globalization of tech but globalization in general And I think what we haven't done well as a society is say let's keep the good because that's great and let's figure out what we can do to change the part that's not working and how we address that And our huge approach there is on education This is the reason we're out in community colleges and so forth and reaching different demographics than we would normally reach through for your schools Define the problem then What's not working in education  I think that — I think that in a lot of ways there's a disconnect between the requirements and great demand for skills in the workplace and the skills and lessons that are being taught in education Coding is an example of this and that I've spoken about And so I think that's part of it I also think that because tech is so integral — not only to this industry but to the world — you want to have kids having access to tech in all neighborhoods; not just those lucky enough and fortunate enough to be born in the right zip code And so this requires bold investment And to me it is — it is job one Even with the wealth that is at the command of this company isn't that a problem you can only work around the edges on You need a different governmental approach to education if your diagnosis of education is correct  The way that I look at Apple's role is that we try to be the ripple in the pond and — because we know yes we're not a small company anymore but in the scheme of things as you point out we are small And so what we try to do is do things that get enough visibility that some other people want to do it too And some more people and more people and more people And we try to find ways that we can you know work with someone else or work with government or whatever to try to make the effort larger than we could ever do on our own And so that's how — that's how we look at it Is it getting harder to follow the values that are important to you as an executive when doing business in China  No No not at all The — we don't — we never move off of our values Never Our values are very clear We — I think everybody in every country in the world knows what they are That doesn't mean that we're fortunate enough or that it's realistic that every country have the same laws And so what we don't do — and I know sometimes people want or some people want us to do this is — we don't believe the way you create change is to stand on the sideline and yell We believe that engagement is the right way And so when we go into countries our litmus test is not they must agree with everything that we agree with If we did there would be states that we weren't in right It wouldn't wouldn't just be countries And so we'd like to go in a place and kind of show what we're about and try to figure out ways that we can create change and show how we treat each other and so forth And we think that's the greatest way to to create change Well here's the thing that's on my mind Given your emphasis on protecting people's personal information — Yeah Was it a difficult call to comply with the Chinese demand that Chinese customers' iCloud data be stored on servers in China where it sounds like the Chinese government might have an easier time accessing it sometime  Well that's a faulty assumption that you're making The same encryption that Apple uses in the United States and in the United Kingdom and in France and in the UAE is the same encryption we use in China And you know iMessage is encrypted end-to-end there and encrypted end-to-end here And they never ask us to break that What they've asked and several other countries are ruminating about is they ask that their citizens' data be stored within the country Right  But I would separate for a minute that that equals access I don't buy that at all Cryptographic keys are also supposed to be kept in the country is that correct  Cryptographic keys it doesn't matter really where they're kept; it matters whether they're safe or not right And keep in mind that the only people that have a key for iMessage — or for messages — are the sender and the receiver That's it Apple doesn't have access to the data I mean that was what the whole — how we got sued in the United States was the US asked us to — In the famous terrorism case right  In that famous case where the US asked us to essentially put a back door in which would allow for access And we said no — this is not good for civilization this is not good for people If — you can't have a backdoor for good people; you put a back door in and it's for everybody And so to everyone else's credit no one else has asked for a back door No one in the world at this point I'm not saying it won't change tomorrow But not — But as a layman when I hear that China this authoritarian state asked you for Chinese citizens' data to be stored in China the presumption is that they want it in China so that sooner or later they can get at it if they need to Is that the wrong presumption Is that the —  It's not the assumption that I make it all I think China has identified cloud services as something very strategic and they want to have Chinese companies involved — or running or so forth —the cloud services in that country And so you can't by law you can't go into China as a foreign company — not just an American company but a foreign company of any country — and operate a cloud service Oh so you view that as just part of China's continuing effort to make sure that there are local partners in whoever's doing business in China  I view it as an economic and sort of technology and innovation kind of focus not a focus on unusual access And one other question along those lines When China asks Apple to remove or delete an app from the App Store because it includes a VPN — a virtual private network which allows people to conceal their communications — is it bothersome to you to comply with that  Yes it absolutely is It's something that we didn't want to do Unfortunately unlike the US where we felt we had the law on our side in the famous case where the FBI sued us we did not have the law on our side in China The law is pretty clear that you have to have a license in China to operate a VPN service And so there actually are still VPN apps on the store Less than there were because there were a set of companies that didn't get a license I see Given the difference in the laws are there requests from Chinese law enforcement that you would grant that you would resist if they were made by US law enforcement  No and frankly we couldn't So let's go back to the basics here The things that law enforcement is generally interested in are messages right Messages for us are end-to-end encrypted Apple doesn't know what you're saying we don't have a record of it we don't store it We don't have a key to it right The key is with the sender and the receiver And you want to keep saying that to Chinese authorities or anybody in the world  Yeah That you can't actually answer their request  Yeah We can't give messages; we don't have it We don't have it So — and by the way we did not do that because of government or law enforcement We didn't do that e did it because we know that if there is a back door and that nefarious things can happen and it can be a public safety issue You know it's not a matter of Apple is presenting itself as some rebel company against the government; it has nothing to do with that What was your recent meeting like with President Trump  It was a — it was a meeting about trade and immigration and some of the topics that we feel very passionate on And I felt he very much listened to the point of view Trade and immigration Let's talk about trade first There seems to be a trade war heating up once again if that's the right phrase The trade war was off and now it seems to be back on What does that — what do the administration's trade policies regarding China mean for Apple  Well there's probably a better person to ask that than me about the current status of negotiations I have no idea Yeah but just what is —  From my point of view — What's at stake for your company  If I zoom out out and talk about trade in general my view is that countries that have a significant level of openness — and I mean that in terms of immigration and trade as an example — are the companies that thrive over time And countries that are more closed do not And so you can look back in history and see this repeating itself again and again and again And so that's how I feel Now I do believe as I mentioned before in here that globalization has created a set of issues And the world wasn't — none of us were as good as we should have been and as fast as we should have been in saying these are the issues and let's figure out what to do about them And so I think that's key But that to me doesn't cut out trade Trade brings people closer together If I can do some business with you I'm going to find out some things about you and we're going to get along a lot better And I think that's true about countries as well you know It's like the — you know even — I do business a lot of small businesses in town; you get to know them you build a relationship It's the same thing for trade between countries And so I think it helps a set of broader issues when there's trade going on  Did you talk to the president on that level About the philosophical benefits of openness  I am — you know I (chuckles) — I am really straightforward kind of guy And I don't have a different view in some person's office than I have in front of you I'm the same old person Take it or leave it but that's who I am And so — you know that's who I am Did you tell him on China specifically a trade war with China is going to cost American jobs  I don't want to get into the details of the conversation because it was a private meeting But — but I think I've been pretty clear with — Well just tell me does a trade war with China cost Apple jobs  Uh I don't think that Apple is going to get caught up in a tariff there But I don't know this but I don't think so because if we were it would hurt the US And so it doesn't make sense to do from that point of view You know I don't — when countries have these huge relationships there is some complexity by its nature and things that have to be worked out And so I think the fact that there is a focus on the trade relationship is perfectly fine and legitimate There should be a focus on trade with a whole variety of countries as a part of the relationship But in terms of throttling it or tariffs which result — which the end result would be a tax on the US consumer I don't think this is good And I think we're in a period of time right now — I mean we the United States — that our economy is doing well We're growing well the unemployment rates are low These things are really important It gives us a chance to focus on a lot of these issues that — inequality-type of issues and where the benefits of this have not been enjoyed by everyone And I think my own belief is that's where a huge amount of our focus should be One other thing I want to ask about because we're at this conference where you're discussing augmented reality you're discussing machine learning that leads over to the phrase artificial intelligence Are you in any way as scared by the prospects of AI getting out of control as say Elon Musk of Tesla is Well I can't attest to what Elon thinks and so forth but here's what I think — and I've said this before and I generally mean it — is I don't really worry about machines thinking like people; I worry about people thinking like machines Because it's the absence of humanity in products that create the issue It's the absence of deep thought about you know what products can do what they can be used for the good and the bad And that's what I worry about that And so I think that the reality is if a machine — for you and I to make it personal — if a machine could do an hour's worth a day of what we are doing this would be a grand thing It'd be a great thing if you could give every American back an hour a day This would be a fabulous thing — Assuming the American is still getting paid for the hour I suppose Well of course Because it's a productivity pickup right And so I think if that's where we wind up that's pretty good That's pretty good People are working really hard in this country and really long hours and so forth And so I think you know that'd be a good thing  And the science fiction scenario of people having to go to war against machines Machines against people They don't seem impressive to you at all  It is not something that I'm focused on and I think the vast majority of people this probably shouldn't be the top thing on their agenda Tim Cook thanks very much  Thank you so much for having me I really enjoyed that conversation Thanks for putting up with it  Thank you Is there anything before we turn off — Laura Sydell NPR technology reporter Can I before we turn off can I just ask one I gotta ask one question   Is it — yeah what do you got Which was this thing that came out today in The Times about Facebook allowing all the — Oh I forgot about that yeah All the — I'm wondering was Apple taking advantage of that Were they able to collect extra data because Facebook allowed this No The things mentioned in The Times article about relationship statuses and all these kinds of stuff this is so foreign to us and not data that we have ever received at all or requested — zero What we did was we integrated the ability to share in the operating system — make it simple to share a photo and that sort of thing So it's a convenience for the user not — we weren't in the data business We've never been in the data business But is the story correct that Facebook was sending that data to you  No no — Not in any way The data — all this the stuff that's mentioned in the article about relationship status and all this kind of stuff No This is simply you were making arrangements to make it easier for Facebook to operate on your platforms is that a layman's way to put this  We were making it more convenient for the user to be able to share photos to their Facebook feeds and this sort of thing Is the story wrong then  No I wouldn't say that because I don't know about — there were 60 people or 60 companies referenced and I don't know about 59 of them I only know about one And so that's the only one I'm

Medicaid Services put in place about a decade ago says Darrell Brown an executive vice president and chief claims officer at Sedgwick Claims Management Services Under the federal rules insurers and plan administrators have to report claims data about Medicare beneficiaries who are also covered by a group health plan or who receive payments under workers' compensation The aim is to ensure that the Medicare program isn't acting as a primary payer on some claims when another health plan or program should be doing so My guess is that there's something that went wrong with that reporting Brown says There's so much data that they're getting and there's so much room for error as well Start by contacting the number or person on the notice you received from the Medicare program denying your claim Brown advises You may also have to contact the workers' compensation insurance carrier But your first step should be to find out why the Medicare program mistakenly believes that your asthma hospitalization and other care are related to your workers' comp injury Why is there a new exemption from the penalty for not having health insurance if you live in a bare county with no marketplace insurers There aren't any of those and next year there's no penalty So what's the point As you note starting next year people will no longer owe a penalty for not meeting the Affordable Care Act's requirement of having health insurance People will however be able to apply to the marketplace for a hardship exemption if they live somewhere where there are no marketplace insurers — a bare county That may give them another option for coverage People who qualify for a hardship or affordability exemption can receive an exemption certificate number often referred to as an ECN which will allow them to buy a catastrophic plan that meets the Affordable Care Act standards — a type of health insurance policy that is usually available only to people under age 30 says Tara Straw a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities These ACA-compliant plans may be purchased outside the exchange even if no insurers are selling marketplace plans in a particular area These catastrophic plans cover the essential health benefits They often have lower premiums than bronze or other metal plans on the ACA marketplace entail but their deductibles are comparatively very high and people can't receive premium tax credits to pay for them The high out-of-pocket costs may explain why they haven't been popular Fewer than 1 percent of marketplace enrollees picked one in 2018 Kaiser Health News a nonprofit news service is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation that is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente Follow Michelle Andrews on Twitter @mandrews110]\",\n",
       " \"[The Russia imbroglio has brought Washington DC to a crossroads that could have historic implications for President Trump and the nation Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller wants to interview Trump about what he knows and why he acted in the way he has The president and his attorneys have all but ruled that out The president denies any wrongdoing Which side will blink If Trump and the White House stick by their decision not to give Mueller an interview the special counsel has a choice of his own Will he accept the arguments made by Trump's attorneys that he already knows everything Trump could tell him and stand down Or would Mueller choose a path seldom traveled and issue a subpoena to try to compel Trump to sit for an interview Here's what you need to know about how we got here — and what may come next The president's attorneys now acknowledge — despite earlier denials by the White House — that he dictated a statement to The New York Times about the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower at which his top campaign deputies hosted a delegation dispatched by the Russian government (Read more about that meeting here) The meeting followed an offer of help to Donald Trump Jr from the Russian government via a series of intermediaries When the Times was on the verge of reporting on the meeting Trump Jr initially said — in the statement written by Trump senior — that the meeting was mostly about adoptions Later Trump Jr released the emails in which the session had been organized Last month it became clear that the Russians used the meeting to give the Trump aides a political opposition research tip although not one according to the accounts of the participants the Russians had initially promised about Hillary Clinton For two reasons First Trump's direct involvement is important if Mueller is building a case that the president has been engaged in a pattern of deception or other behavior that amounts to obstruction of justice Prosecutors might group this together with other examples since Inauguration Day And second it raises questions about how closely Trump has been involved all along with the contacts between people in his campaign and Russian operatives Trump has said he wasn't aware that Russia was attacking the presidential election in 2016 or that his aides were interacting with Russians at that time Trump himself has been described as not a target of the FBI's investigation But the Senate Judiciary Committee revealed last month that as Trump Jr was arranging the meeting at which he hosted his Russian guests he made two phone calls to a blocked number Trump Jr told senators he didn't remember with whom he spoke Trump senior is known to have used a blocked number If Mueller's investigators established that Trump Jr did in fact phone his father that could suggest that Trump senior knew at the time of the meeting at least that it was taking place That raises questions about how much else Trump knew about the overtures the Russian government had been making to his campaign since spring 2016 If Trump did know about what was happening — even if neither he nor his aides actually conspired with the ongoing Russian active measures — that might have given him an incentive to frustrate efforts by FBI investigators to find out about what his campaign aides had done or what he knew Mueller's investigators want to ask about all this They've been resisting confidentially and they've also been litigating their case in the press Trump's legal team argues not only that Trump did not break the law that prohibits obstructing justice but that in short he cannot commit that crime His actions as president all have been within the authority afforded him by the Constitution the lawyers say If he asked then-FBI Director James Comey to lay off the case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn that was within Trump's power they argue because he can end any investigation for any reason And the Constitution also gives Trump the privilege to fire Comey or nearly anyone else under him in the executive branch the president's legal team says for any reason \\n                President Trump waves to visitors as he walks across the South Lawn before boarding Marine One and departing the White House on June 1 2018\\n                \\n                \\n                    \\n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n President Trump waves to visitors as he walks across the South Lawn before boarding Marine One and departing the White House on June 1 2018 And Trump not only couldn't have obstructed justice according to this line of argument the president argued on Monday that even if he had broken any law he has the power to pardon himself Trump in claiming that privilege stopped short of saying he might use it and his attorney Rudy Giuliani said separately that the president recognized that pardoning himself might bring on a severe political backlash All the same the manifold claims about executive power appear to add up to a message to the special counsel Trump has not and cannot do anything wrong in this context and even if he had he has the authority to make all this go away So what comes next The special counsel's office simply could drop its request for an interview with Trump Mueller then could do whatever other work he believes he has set out for him No one knows whether Mueller intends to file charges against other people in the Russia case — for example to indict the Russian cyber-operatives who stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and other political targets in 2016 and then arranged for them to be released to embarrass their targets Mueller also must compile a written report about the Russian attack on the 2016 election and the subsequent events The governing regulations oblige Mueller to submit his report to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who appointed him but Rosenstein has no obligation of his own to give the report to Congress or make it public (The regulations do however appear to require Rosenstein to notify the chairmen and ranking members of both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees when the special counsel's investigation is concluded) If however the investigation results in a book-length Mueller Report as there have been major reports by past congressional committees or special prosecutors it could eventually find its way into the light of day At very least Mueller finally might tell the full story of the Russian attack on the 2016 presidential election about which many questions remain If Mueller has found no wrongdoing by the president he also could clear Trump and the nation could move on Or if Mueller discovers wrongdoing he could put the onus for action on Congress or voters it would be up to the democratic process to deal with Trump if Mueller argued the president had transgressed somehow The Justice Department might also signal whether it planned to file charges against Trump once he no longer was president — either because he had been removed by Congress voters or his term limit — given the orthodox view within DOJ that it cannot indict a sitting president If the president won't agree to an interview that Mueller felt would address his questions Mueller's office could obtain a subpoena from a grand jury That would seek to compel Trump to sit for the interview but no one knows what might happen next In the case of President Bill Clinton the White House responded to a subpoena by negotiating an interview in the White House with independent counsel Ken Starr Clinton agreed to appear before the grand jury via closed-circuit TV rather than having to physically go to a federal courthouse Starr withdrew the subpoena So although presidents have done interviews with high-level investigators in the past the legal assertions that Trump's lawyers have made about his powers and privileges have never actually been tested in a court battle in modern times Of course But there are political implications — in past Trump has criticized taking the Fifth as a de facto admission of guilt Yes If Trump's attorneys were determined to fight they could ask a federal judge to throw out the subpoena They could make arguments like the ones they reportedly made in their letter to Mueller's office that first the Constitution confers on the president unique powers and responsibilities that protect him from a subpoena and second that the special counsel's office has already received all the information it would get from Trump in other ways That puts the ball in Mueller's court Giuliani said on Sunday that although the door isn't completely closed to an interview he and Trump are strongly leaning against one — as has been the case for weeks No matter what happens no meeting between Trump and Mueller's team would take place until after Trump's planned summit in Singapore on June 12 Giuliani said There's no telling — even if the Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments about the matter on an expedited basis given the importance of the case The high court would stand at a crossroads of its own If it recognized Trump's assertion that the president can reject a subpoena it would be a historic vindication and add yet more power to an office that has been gaining in its reach since President Franklin Roosevelt If the Supreme Court ordered Trump to appear before a grand jury — either in person or in a Clinton-like arrangement via video — that would be a historic move all on its own That could take months or years but the relevant decisions by Trump his lawyers Mueller and his office could take place within the next few weeks]\",\n",
