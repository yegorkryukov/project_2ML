attract crossparty voters time gill team cited new statistic called efficiency gap basically measured difference fair districts unfair ones case wisconsin gap oral argument court conservatives extremely skeptical number math went reasoning much much infamously chief justice roberts called sociological gobbledgygook today decision threw math entirely fact court said one challenge map whole

democratic packed political map packs many democrats districts possible sure vote meaningful like living new york california presidential election prove magic number diluted map unconstitutional unless smoking gun minutes meeting someone says hey let screw district adding even democrats hard see make claim least efficiency gap mathematical evidence justice kagan concurring opinion joined court three liberals tried paint lipstick pig saying enough plaintiffs aggregated together entire map could challenged redrawn moreover added claims besides voter dilution first amendment claims free association unusually chief justice opinion specifically dismissed view saying opinion court rests understanding lack jurisdiction decide case much less draw speculative advisory conclusions regarding
